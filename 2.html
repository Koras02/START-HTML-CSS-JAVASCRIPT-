    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a
    markup language such as HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
    JavaScript.[2]
    
    CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This
    separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation
    characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file
    which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to
    improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>

        The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system where documents and other web
        resources
        are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as https://example.com/), which may be interlinked by
        hypertext,
        and are accessible over the Internet.[1][2] The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer
        Protocol
        (HTTP), may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser, and are published by a software
        application called a web server. The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet, which pre-existed the
        Web in
        some form by over two decades and upon whose technologies the Web is built.

        English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser in 1990
        while
        employed at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland.[3][4] The browser was released outside CERN to other research
        institutions
        starting in January 1991, and then to the general public in August 1991. The World Wide Web has been central to
        the
        development of the Information Age, and is the primary tool billions of people use to interact on the
        Internet.[5][6][7][8][9]
